# AdmiNUS User Guide

## Why AdmiNUS?

AdmiNUS is a contact management tool designed for NUS club administrators, student leaders, and event coordinators. It provides an easy and efficient way to manage contacts via a Command Line Interface (CLI), making it perfect for users who prefer typing over navigating complex menus.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">ðŸ’¡ **Example Use Case**: Suppose you are organizing an NUS event with over 200 participants, including student volunteers and vendors. With AdmiNUS, adding, editing, and filtering contacts is quick and straightforward. For example, to add a student:

 ```shell
 student n/John Doe s/A0123456X p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 Clementi Rd, #02-01 t/volunteer
 ```
 This command adds John Doe instantly, tagged as a volunteer. You can then use commands like `filtertag volunteer` to find all volunteers, saving time compared to traditional methods. </div>

AdmiNUS helps you stay organized and efficient, letting you focus on running successful events.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar adminus.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/viewContactUI.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list`: Lists all contacts.

   * `student n/John Doe id/A0123456Z p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: Adds a student named `John Doe` to the AdmiNUS.

   * `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear`: Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit`: Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

ðŸ”” **Notes about the command format**: <br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

---

### File Operations

#### Importing CSV files: `import`

Imports data from a CSV file, use the import command followed by the path to your CSV file. This allows you to quickly load structured data into your application or script for further analysis and processing.

Format: `import /path/to/data/File.csv`

* `/path/to/data/File.csv` should be the full path to the CSV file you wish to import. Replace `/path/to/data/File.csv` with the actual path to your file. Ensure that the file path is correct and accessible to avoid errors.

Example:

* `import /home/user/data/hackers_2022.csv` imports the CSV file named hackers_2022 from the data directory located in the user's home directory. Once imported, the data can be manipulated or used within the program

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> ðŸ“‚ **Important Notes**:

* Make sure to use the correct file path. For Windows, use backslashes or double backslashes (e.g., `C:\Users\username\data\File.csv`). 
* The CSV file should be properly formatted, with each value separated by commas and each row ending with a newline character.  
* Ensure you have the necessary read permissions for the file. If you encounter a permission denied error, you may need to adjust the file permissions or run the command with the required privileges. 

</div>

Troubleshooting:

* If you receive an error indicating that the file is not found, double-check the file path and ensure that the CSV file exists in the specified location.
* If the CSV is not properly formatted, importing may fail. Make sure the file follows the standard CSV format (e.g., no extra commas).

#### Exporting CSV Files
Export data to a CSV file, use the export command followed by the desired path and filename for your CSV. This command allows you to save the current data in a structured format that can be easily shared or used by other applications.

Format: `export /path/to/data/File.csv`

* `/path/to/data/File.csv` should be the full path where you want to save the CSV file. Replace `/path/to/data/File.csv` with the actual path and filename for your exported file. Ensure that the directory exists and you have the correct permissions to write to it.

Example:

* `export /home/user/data/output_data.csv` exports the current dataset to a CSV file named `output_data.csv` in the data directory located in the user's home directory. This file can then be opened or shared for further use.
* `export ./data/Output.csv` exports the data to a CSV file named Output.csv in the data subdirectory of the current working directory. This approach is useful when you want to save data relative to your current location.

Important Notes:

* Ensure that the directory you are exporting to exists. For Windows, use backslashes or double backslashes, e.g., `C:\Users\username\data\File.csv`.
* If the specified file already exists, it may be overwritten without warning. Ensure you use a unique filename or double-check if overwriting is acceptable.
* Make sure you have the necessary write permissions for the directory you are exporting to. If you encounter a permission denied error, adjust the file permissions or run the command with the required privileges.

Troubleshooting:

* If the directory does not exist, you will receive an error. Create the directory first or specify a valid path.
* If you do not have the necessary write permissions, you will need to adjust them or choose a different directory.

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AdminNUS will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
